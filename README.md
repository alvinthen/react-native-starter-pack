# react-native-starter-pack
Start your react native project with eslint and flowtype configured.

## Usage
1. Clone the project
  * If you like, delete the `.git` folder and run `git init` for a fresh copy without any history, or run git clone with `--depth 1`
1. Run `yarn` or `npm i`.
1. Rename the project [(reference)](http://blog.skypayjm.com/2016/07/renaming-react-native-project.html)

#### Todo list
- [ ] Add redux/ducks into template
- [x] Bring F8's createStylesheet into template
- [ ] Implement simple navigation using `NavigationExperimental`

I will try to keep the starter pack up to date whenever react native has new releases.
